This software (web page) is used to calculate required points in German football/soccer leagues in order to achieve a specific target in the running season ('Saisonziel') - e.g., not being relegated, qualifying for international competitions.

It leverages data from https://www.openligadb.de via API and calculates required points using an adapted version of Heinrich Hemmes mathematical riddle 'Meister und Absteiger' - https://www.spektrum.de/raetsel/meister-und-absteiger/1777404. It uses styles by W3.CSS and icons by https://icons8.com.

More information can be found in index.html (German only).
